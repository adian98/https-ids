The parsable output has the following stucture:

srcip|dstip|port|packet_mean|packet_stdev|bytes_mean|bytes_stdev|duration_mean|duration_stdev|flows|flow_duration|activity|total_duration|first_seen|last_seen|signature|urls

The last field, the urls, are set up as follows: url\count\url\count... etc
The count is how many times the page has been accessed by that srcip.

In the case of Absolom the output is similar:
srcip|dstip|port|packet_mean|bytes_mean|attack|first_seen|last_seen|signature|urls
