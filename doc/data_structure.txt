The internal datastucture used by ids.py looks like this:

srcip:                                                                  source ip of the attacker

                    duration_mean:                                      mean of duration per flow

                    total_duration:                                     time between first seen and last seen

                    signature:                                          contains the matching signature

The Absolom algorithm uses different fields under the dstip:

dstip:
    packet_mean:                                                        same as above
    bytes_mean:                                                         same as above
    flows:                                                              flows that match the given signature
    cusum:                                                              average cusum streak
    first_seen:                                                         same as above
    last_seen:                                                          same as above
    signature:                                                          same as above
    url:                                                                same as above
